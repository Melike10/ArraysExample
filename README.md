# Array Manipulation in C# - Week5 Practice

This project is a simple C# console application that demonstrates basic array manipulation techniques, including initialization, adding elements, resizing, and sorting. The code was created as part of the Patika Dev Week 5 practice for learning basic C# array operations.

## Steps

1. **Array Initialization:**
   - A 10-element integer array is created and filled with random numbers between 1 and 100.

2. **Displaying Array Elements:**
   - The array elements are displayed on the console using a `foreach` loop.

3. **Adding a New Element:**
   - The user is prompted to enter an additional number, which is then added as the 11th element of the array.

4. **Resizing and Sorting:**
   - The array is resized to accommodate the new element.
   - The array is sorted in ascending order, and then the sorted array is displayed in descending order.

## How to Run

- Simply compile and run the code in a C# compatible environment or IDE like Visual Studio.
- Follow the on-screen prompts to add a new number and see the updated array.

## Technologies Used

- C#
- .NET Core Console Application
